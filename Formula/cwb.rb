      cwb is installed as a command on PATH.

      If you previously installed cwb by sourcing it from your shell profile,
      remove this line and open a new shell:

        source "#{opt_prefix}/cwb"
    EOS
  end

  test do
    output = shell_output("#{bin}/cwb --version")
    assert_match "cwb", output
  end
